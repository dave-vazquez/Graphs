graphs:

vertices (nodes), weights

graph types:

directed graph, uni-directional movement
undirected graph, multi-directional movement
cyclic graph, edges allow you to revisit at least one vert
acyclic graph - vertices can only be visted once


depth first search - explore each branch to deepest level, uses a stack data-structure

breadth-first search - explore levels closest to the root, and finishing at those furhters away, uses a queue data-structure
                        good for solving a derivate of the "shortest" path problem or other scnearios where you know the      
                        solution is NOT far from the root.
