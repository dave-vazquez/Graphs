disjointed graphs 

In a disjoint graph, groups of nodes on a graph that are connected to each other

connected components are the groups of nodes connected to one another

you can find connected components using BFS

  How:

    loop through each node in the graph
      a. has it been explored?
        No? - Do BFS
        on completion, all the nodes you reach are connected!

        Yes? already in a connected components
